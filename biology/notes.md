# Biology Notes

## Chapter Two

### Section 1

Atoms are made up of subatomic particles Electrons (-), protons (+), neutrons (no charge) Atoms have shells, the outer most shell is called valence Electrons
Mostly made up of CHNOP
See notes on Portal

### Section 2

Water consists of 2 Hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom
Electronegativity: a more electronegative atom attracts electrons more strongly in a bond than a less electronegative atom in a bond
Electrons spend more time around the oxygen atom than the Hydrogen atoms, water is a polar molocule, and polar covelant
Oxygens are slightly negative and hydrogens are slightly positive
Hydrogen bonds occurs between two different molecules, the hydrogen positive in one molecule and the negative atom in another
Hydrogen bonding in water is responsible for most of waters capacity
Cohesion is the attraction between water molecules that leads to surface tension
Adhesion is the attraction between water molecules and other substances
